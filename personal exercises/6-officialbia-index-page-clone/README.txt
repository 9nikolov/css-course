# Project Overview ðŸš€

The goal is to visually replicate the index page of [officialbia.com](https://www.officialbia.com/) and ensure mobile responsiveness.

## Project Approach ðŸ› 

The primary rule is to practice and apply acquired skills independently, without relying on code inspection. This approach encourages the development of coding style and problem-solving skills.

## Current Knowledge ðŸ“š
