Conclusion:

I started out trying to create a masonry gallery layout but
ended up creating a standard layout instead.

A true masonry layout is typically achieved using JavaScript or CSS frameworks like
Masonry.js or CSS Grid.

If you want to create a true masonry layout without relying on external libraries,
you may need to use a combination of JavaScript and CSS, or 
use the newer CSS Grid properties for a more dynamic layout.
