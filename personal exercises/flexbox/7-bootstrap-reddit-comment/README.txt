## Important Note

While this mini project discusses the drawbacks of using Bootstrap, it's essential to note that I don't have anything against Bootstrap. I can recognize its use case scenarios and appreciate its value in certain contexts. This article, written by u/MrQuickLine, has provided valuable insights that helped me gain a clearer understanding of Bootstrap's limitations. The intention is not to disrespect Bootstrap but to encourage developers to explore alternative approaches and gain a deeper understanding of CSS. Bootstrap remains a powerful tool, and its suitability depends on the specific project requirements.
