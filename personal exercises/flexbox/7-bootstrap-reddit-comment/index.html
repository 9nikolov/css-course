        <h2>Bootstrap is opinionated.</h2>
        <p>
          Why do you need their opinions if you've got your own? How much time
          do you spend overwriting design choices Bootstrap made? Does every
          page and every part of the layout really require 12 columns? Or are
          there places where one element uses all 12 columns? Are there places
          where you only need two columns that wrap to one at a certain width?
        </p>

        <h2>Bootstrap has bloat.</h2>
        <p>
          Granted. This is way better than it used to be 6 years ago. And in
          fact, I would argue that for most people, it was better in Bootstrap 3
          than it is in 4. Someone has to understand build tools if they want to
          be able to pull in only the required components into their project.
          But with Boostrap you're ALWAYS pulling in more code than your
          client's browser needs. There is ALWAYS unused CSS that your client's
          browser is going to render. For most of North America, it's not a
          problem. But it is for some people. Not everyone browses on a 4G
          connection. Not everyone has tonnes of data. You can do a great
          service to people by keeping things as light-weight as possible.
          Studies show that website that take too long to load lose customers.
          Period. You should be doing everything you can on consumer websites to
          load data as quickly as possible, and that means only loading the CSS
          and JS you absolutely require.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Bootstrap site looks like everyone else's.</h2>
        <p>
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dagusa.com/">www.dagusa.com</a> -
          I hope you're not offended by swearing, but this satirical site isn't
          wrong.

          has a similar point. Bootstrap looks like Bootstrap. If you're doing
          client work, you're risking your site looking exactly like their
          competitors. Offer something original! Given the option, do you want
          to buy the suit off the rack, or do you want to go to a tailor and
          have something designed for you? What's going to put your better foot
          forward? When you start off, maybe you can't afford anything but the
          rack, but as you learn more and more CSS and get better at it, the
          difference in effort between general-purpose and beautiful bespoke CSS
          becomes negligible.

        <h2>
          You can not find a senior front-end developer,<br />
          that would advocate for it on a production site.
        </h2>
        <p>
          I've been doing this CSS thing a long time, and in the past 5 years,
          I've worked really hard to push myself and become way, way better. I'm
          now earning more than double what I was four years ago, and triple
          what I was earning 7 years ago. I'm Sr. level in my job, and most of
          my job is writing HTML and CSS for really large software applications.
          Getting here involved a lot of reading, attending a lot of
          conferences, and working with some really friggin' smart people.
          Bootstrap is great for rapid prototyping. I'm not saying people should
          never use it. I'm saying that I've never met anyone that's at a senior
          level that advocates for using it in production. I hope you can
          understand that there must be some wisdom that isn't just my opinion
          that stops people from wanting to use it.
        </p>

        <h2>Class naming can be done well!</h2>
        <p>
          Look at <a target="_blank" href="https://getbem.com/">BEM</a> and/or
          <a target="_blank" href="https://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a> and/or

            >ITCSS</a
          >. You can do class-naming well on your own. There are lots of ways to
          make it work.
        </p>

        <h2>You'll be a better developer if you drop the crutch.</h2>
        <p>
          If you can write your own, you'll understand CSS better. Period. You
          can write the CSS you need and ONLY the CSS you need. Grid is amazing,
          and it's got great browser support (though it still needs a little
          care taking care of IE, but it's not insurmountable). I genuinely
          believe that in 1-2 work days, I could write a framework for myself.
          After that was done, if you handed me a design for a website, I could
          create it faster with my own framework than I could with Bootstrap
          without sacrificing readability or maintainability. It would have
          fewer lines of both HTML and CSS, and would still be accessible and
          responsive. You can learn to do this! It will make you a better
          developer, and depending on what job specifically you're doing, I
          can't imagine that getting better won't help you earn more dollars in
          the long run. I can tell you that if I was hiring someone today, and
          they had your philosophy of "why use anything else?" I'd probably put
          their resume at the bottom of the pile.

        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          As a bit of a metaphor, there's this woodworking YouTuber named
          Matthias Wandel. He has worked with wood for a very long time, And
          when he encounters a problem or a shortcoming with a tool, he builds
          his own. He has invented tools (Google "pantorouter"). He wanted a
          bigger bandsaw, so he built one. He built a lathe, a strip sander,
          etc... He builds the tools he needs, and they're built exactly the way
          he wants them. They're perfect for him. You can build things exactly
          the way you want, and you'll be better for it. MAYBE you'll fail along
          the way, but here's a genuine offer. If you're ever struggling with
          CSS, you can post here or at
          <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/css/">r/css</a> - if you don't get a
          satisfactory answer, DM me directly, and I will help you. If you want
          code reviews or advice or are struggling with something, I'll spend
          time to help you with it. You can do better than Bootstrap!
