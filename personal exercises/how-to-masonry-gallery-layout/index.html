    <h1>How to achieve a Masonry Gallery Layout</h1>
    <h2>1. CSS Columns vs Flexbox vs CSS Grid</h2>
    <h3>1.1. CSS Columns</h3>
    <p>
      CSS Columns are well-suited for static web pages with unchanging number of
      images.<br />
      For more control over layouts with unpredictable amount of images,
      consider using CSS Grid.
    </p>
    <h3>1.2. Flexbox</h3>
    <p>
      Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system, designed for
      single-directional item arrangement (row or column). <br />Using it for
      masonry layouts will require more code, additional adjustments and
      workarounds.
    </p>
    <h3>1.3. CSS Grid</h3>
    <p>
      CSS Grid is a powerful two-dimensional layout system that provides a
      highly flexible and efficient way to structure web page layouts. <br />CSS
      Grid excels at handling both rows and columns simultaneously.
      <br /><br />Out of CSS Columns, Flexbox and Grid, Grid is often the
      preferred choice. <br />One notable advantage is its ability to handle an
      unpredictable number of images with ease.<br />
      Even with less content, the masonry layout remains functional without
      resulting in empty columns.
    </p>
    <h2>2. JavaScript Libraries</h2>
    <p>
      To streamline the implementation of a masonry gallery layout, you can
      leverage JavaScript libraries specifically designed for this purpose.
      Examples include Masonry.js, Isotope, and Packery. These libraries provide
      ready-made solutions, simplifying the dynamic positioning of elements on
      your webpage to achieve an aesthetically pleasing masonry grid layout.
      Incorporating these JavaScript libraries can save development time and
      enhance the responsiveness of your gallery.
